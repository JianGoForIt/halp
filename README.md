High-Accuracy Low-Precision Training
====================================
This repo contains a PyTorch implementation of the HALP optimizer from the paper [High-Accuracy Low-Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03383) and a SVRG optimizer.

This repo is duplicated from the source code of PyTorch-based HALP repo from [Megan Leszczynski](https://github.com/mleszczy) under permission. This repo is only used for the Low-precision Random Fourier Feature project.
